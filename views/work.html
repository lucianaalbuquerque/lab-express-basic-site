                <p>"Barbara had a way of feeling forms, not with her fingers, but with the palms of her hands."<br>
                    Hepworth is known first and foremost as a sculptor, but she also worked in other mediums â€“ and was very interested in documenting her own work through photography. The landscape around St Ives became part of the way her works were presented in the media; St Ives Bay, Godrevy Lighthouse and The Island all become compositional tools for those documenting her works, creating an additional dialogue between the forms and their surroundings.</p>
